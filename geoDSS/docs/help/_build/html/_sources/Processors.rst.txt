Processors
==========

geoDSS has many processors which, together with the :ref:`tests`, provide the fundamental building blocks for a :ref:`rule set <ruleset>`.

A processor alters the subject, and optionally reports. Eg. put a buffer around a point, or geocode an address.

Processors are explained in the `processors section of the API documentation <https://marcoduiker.github.io/geoDSS/geoDSS/docs/API/processors/index.html>`_
